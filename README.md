# Retroma Obsidian Theme

![retroma-banner.png](assets/screenshots/retroma-banner.png)

Your notes? Chaos. Your vault? A digital junkyard. But fear not, **Retroma** is here to trick everyone (including you) into thinking your workspace has its life together.

## 🌟 Key Features

Retroma gives you the best of both worlds, taking inspiration from classic and nostalgic designs of software and websites to create a theme that still feels professional and refined. It's a tribute to the past, reminding us of a time when buttons looked like you could actually press them and when UI actually had personality, Retroma brings that back without sacrificing usability or making your screen look like a MySpace profile circa 2006....unless you’re really determined to make it ugly.

### 🎨 Intelligent Color Scheme Algorithm

The magic starts with Retroma's advanced color algorithm so advanced, it probably has a Ph.D. in aesthetics. You pick one accent color, and Retroma's algorithm does the rest, creating a complete and harmonious palette. It’s like hiring a personal color consultant who works for free, doesn’t sleep, and never judges your questionable font choices.

### ⚙️ Extensive Customization

Think you’ve got an eye for design? Prove it. Thanks to full integration with the [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) plugin, Retroma gives you near-total control. Rotate your color scheme, fine-tune folder icon saturation to match your mood, or adjust typography until it feels “just right.” No judgment here, this is your chance to show the world your inner perfectionist.

> Install the [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) plugin from the community plugins to access all of Retroma's extensive customization, theme variations, and extra features.

### 🎭️ Theme Variations

![retroma-border-showcase.gif](assets/screenshots/retroma-border-showcase.gif)

I've also included three distinct variants to match your vibe:
- **Groovy:** A retro-inspired design with a focus on depth and distinct borders, ideal for those who appreciate classic aesthetics.
- **Simple:** A balanced variant that offers a clean, modern look while retaining the theme's core retro elements.
- **Minimalist:** A stripped-down version that emphasizes simplicity and clarity, focusing on essential design elements.

### ⭐️ Extra Features

- Adjustable border radius, because yes, corners are a personality trait
- Image settings (still wip...)
- Hide/show headings and footnote dividers
- Custom highlighter colors for light and dark mode, because neon yellow isn’t always the vibe
- Redesigned #tags with built-in options like:
    - #todo (spoiler: you won’t do it)
    - #home
    - #work
    - #high
    - #medium
    - #low (the tag where most tasks end up)
- …more coming soon, because I’m indecisive 😝

## 📍 Note from the Developer

Retroma is still a work in progress, a passion project born from my love of retro design and my hatred of endless customization menus. Big thanks to [@codeisconfusing](https://github.com/codeisconfusing) for the inspiration (and button code) from their [Retro Windows Obsidian Theme](https://github.com/codeisconfusing/retro-windows-obsidian).
